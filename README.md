# SDL2 Clicker Game

## A working clicker game made with SDL2 in C++.

## Important Information:
* The entry point for the application is "Source.cpp".
* The main game logic is under "Game.cpp".
* Most of the game logic is located in the "Forever" method (which is run frame-by-frame similarly to most game engines).
